_A webpage where a user can select the name of a movie, the time of day that they would like to see the movie and their age. The webpage lets them know how much their movie ticket will cost, based on those three factors and considering that non-"first-release" movies, matinee and senior tickets are cheaper than the regular priced ticket._
